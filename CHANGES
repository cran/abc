Changes in abc 1.8
============================

---------
  o The problem in the abc function that arises when using kernel="gaussian" is fixed
  o Checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
  ‘library’ or ‘require’ call to ‘nnet’ which was already attached by Depends.
  Please remove these calls from your code. 
	require(nnet) removed from postpr.R
  o Changes in the details of the summary.cv4abc.Rd function
  o Compression of the data with the resaveRdaFiles function  (package tools ) 
  	
	
Changes in abc 1.7
============================

---------
  o In the getmode function of the abc.R file
  		d$x[which(d$y == max(d$y))] replaced by  d$x[which(d$y == max(d$y))][1]
  o In the cv4postpr function
  	The line
  	 subres <- withCallingHandlers( postpr(target = mytarget, index = myindex, sumstat = mysumstat, tol=mytol,
                         subset = mysubset, method = method, kernel = kernel), warning = namesWarningFilter)
    has been changed and there is no call to withCallingHandlers anymore


Changes in abc 1.6
============================

---------
  o Add 2 times (mnlogistic and neural net)
  		ss<-data.frame(ss)
        colnames(ss)<-statnames 
        in postpr so that mnlogistic and neural net work when there is only one sum stat
  o Michael Blum is the unique maintainer conforming to the new CRAN policy

  o Michael Blum is the unique maintainer conforming to the new CRAN policy


Changes in abc 1.5
============================

---------
  o Add the reference to the MEE paper in the CITATION file and in the vignette
  try and enjoy
  >if(nchar(system.file(package="abc"))) citation("abc")
  o Add the AIC and BIC computation in the abc function.
  They are used to select a subset of informative statistics.
  It is the AIC/BIC of the local linear regression that is returned.
