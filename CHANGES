Changes in abc 1.7
============================

---------
  o In the getmode function of the abc.R file
  		d$x[which(d$y == max(d$y))] replaced by  d$x[which(d$y == max(d$y))][1]
  o In the cv4postpr function
  	The line
  	 subres <- withCallingHandlers( postpr(target = mytarget, index = myindex, sumstat = mysumstat, tol=mytol,
                         subset = mysubset, method = method, kernel = kernel), warning = namesWarningFilter)
    has been changed and there is no call to withCallingHandlers anymore


Changes in abc 1.6
============================

---------
  o Add 2 times (mnlogistic and neural net)
  		ss<-data.frame(ss)
        colnames(ss)<-statnames 
        in postpr so that mnlogistic and neural net work when there is only one sum stat
  o Michael Blum is the unique maintainer conforming to the new CRAN policy
